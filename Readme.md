# Objectif:

Create a website where customers can create their account, and can pay 5 dollars to have access to an affiliate link that allows them to gain 5 dollars for the first person that they get signed in and subscribed, and 3 dollars for every other person.


# Tasks:

## Creating the Website
(More Details should be filled here)

## Having User Account management with email verification

## Implementing a payment Gateway
Users can pay and receive money from its account to its bank.

## Having an affiliate link associted with each subscriber
Each subscriber should have its own link to the website where if someone subscribes with that link, they get to receive their share in their account
Or a simpler way, every subscribed account has a code that people can subscribe with instead of having the link



# Upcoming features:

## Allow users to subscribe paying by time and not money
There is plenty of websites that allows you to make money by trading your time, filling surveys for example or watching ads.

## Create a greater Pyramid
This will be more like a graph with multiple nodes, and for the moment only the parent of the node can profit from it.
A greater set up would be that when you invite someone, you profit from every one that that certain one invites and so on.
So not only people can make money by inviting other people continuously, they can do it just once and profit from whatever that one invites.

The percentage of the profits can be shared up to 20%, for example if someone invites another, they get 3 dollars and the one above that would get 5% percent of 2 dollars, and that percentage gets lower when the number of nodes in between gets bigger

## Provide a service for every subscriber

We can Share information with subscribers to get free money, using UberEats for example, when they can Get 90 Euros worth of food for each Credit Card they have
